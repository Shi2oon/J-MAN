function [A_new] = transform(A_old,a)
% Tensor transformation for 2nd rank tensor
% Takes tensor 'A_old', defined with respect to 'old' axes, and transforms to
%  tensor 'A_new', defined with respect to the new axes.
% The matrix a contains the direction cosines a(i,j) of the transformation.
% In Einstein Summation Convention, A_new_ij = a_ik a_jl A_old_kl
