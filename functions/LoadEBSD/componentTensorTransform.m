% Input: 
% series of 9 maps representing the spatial variation of the 9
% components of a second rank tensor, with respect to an old co-ordinate
% system.  The transformation from the old to the new co-ordinate system is
% defined by the direction cosine matrix a.

% Output: 
% series of 9 maps representing the spatial variation of the
% components of the same system, this time with respect to the new
% co-ordinate system
